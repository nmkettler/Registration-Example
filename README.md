# Angular-Registration
 
## What is this?
 
 A great basis for user registration you would like to implement on your site. Built with an angularJS MVC type structure. Google's Firebase to control the user authentication and simple data storage. 
 
## Code Example
 
 myApp.factory('Authentication', 
   ['$rootScope', '$firebaseAuth', '$firebaseObject',
   '$location', 'FIREBASE_URL',
   function($rootScope, $firebaseAuth, $firebaseObject,
     $location, FIREBASE_URL) {...
 
## Motivation
 
 I have created several other user registrations with PHP but this is by far the cleanest/elegant solutions I have come up with. I wanted to organize all of the authentication into one javascript file (authentication.js). By doing this, the controllers are clean and not cluttered. 
 
## Installation
 
 Just clone the repo in a folder on your Desktop. Make sure the CDNs are up to date. I decided to download angularJS instead of using the CDN however either way should be fine. 
 
## API Reference
